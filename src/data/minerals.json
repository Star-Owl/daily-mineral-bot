Aragonite differs from calcite in its crystal structure and various physical properties. It is commonly found in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and can also be formed in various biological processes.\n\n*Fun Fact:* The famous 'Cave of the Crystals' in Mexico features some of the world's largest natural crystals, which are made of aragonite.\n\n[More about Aragonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonite)",

Sphalerite is known for its exceptional dispersion, which results in gem-quality stones displaying a brilliant fire similar to diamonds.\n\n*Fun Fact:* Despite its beauty, gem-quality sphalerite is rarely used in jewelry due to its softness and sensitivity to light, which can cause it to darken over time.\n\n[More about Sphalerite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphalerite)",
